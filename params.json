{"name":"Tom Castleman","tagline":"Web Software Engineer, IT Consultant, Solution Architect","body":"## Web Software Engineer\r\n\r\nI solve business problems with well designed & tested solid software solutions. I have been working with PHP for over 10 years and take active interest in the latest technologies & best practices in a language which has really started to nicely mature in recent years.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have used various frameworks including CodeIgnitor, Fuel, & Kohana 3. I love Composer & Packagist and the structure & ecosystem those bring to PHP application development. When I need more Laravel and Symfony are frameworks I really enjoy to use. Where possible I like to contribute to the open source software I use, including the Laravel core & docs. I have also released Laravel extensions to implement missing functionality for my projects.\r\n\r\nWhilst I slightly prefer backend development and have lots of experience in database design and using PHP with MySQL, PostgreSQL, & SQLServer, I also have lots of experience with the front end and I have been experimenting with VueJS recently. Naturally I work with HTML5, CSS3/SASS, lots of jQuery. I love the new frontend build features of Laravel 5 including elixir.\r\n\r\nFrom a devops perspective I have been working with Ubuntu since its inception and daily I work with build processes supporting apps and have experience working with AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean etc.\r\n\r\nI have recently been involved with the new Laravel Birmingham meet up and I am scheduled to give talks in the coming months. I want to get involved in the PHP community and in 2015 I kicked this off with LaraconEU.\r\n\r\nI participate in various forums and like to follow and keep up to date with the community. Currently I am interested in discussions on software design patterns and testing methodologies.\r\n\r\n## IT Consultant\r\n\r\nWith my business partner I have run [B3 IT Consulting](http://b3it.co) since 2004. Over the years I have worked on projects covering a wide variety of IT disciplines.\r\n\r\n## Solution Architect\r\n\r\nLorum Ipsum\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n[Personal Github](https://github.com/tomcastleman)\r\n[Company Github](https://github.com/b3it)\r\n[Company Website](http://www.b3it.co)\r\n[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tomcastleman)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
