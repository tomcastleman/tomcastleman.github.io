                    <h2>Web Software Engineer</h2>

                    <p>
                        I solve business problems with robust, well designed &amp; tested software solutions.
                        I have been working with PHP for over 10 years and take an active interest in the latest
                        technologies &amp; best practices in a language which has really started to mature
                        in recent years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the years I have used various frameworks including CodeIgnitor, Fuel, &amp; Kohana 3.
                        I love Composer &amp; Packagist, the structure &amp; ecosystem they bring to modern PHP
                        application development, and Laravel &amp; Symfony are frameworks I enjoy using. Where possible
                        I like to
                        contribute to open source projects, including
                        the Laravel core &amp; docs. I have also released Laravel extensions to implement missing
                        functionality for my projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whilst I slightly prefer backend development and have lots of experience in database design and
                        using PHP
                        with MySQL, PostgreSQL, &amp; SQLServer, I also have lots of experience with the front end and I
                        have been
                        experimenting with VueJS recently. Naturally I work with HTML5, CSS3/SASS, lots of jQuery. I
                        love the new
                        frontend build features of Laravel 5 including elixir.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From a devops perspective I have been working with Ubuntu since its inception and daily I work
                        with build
                        processes supporting apps and have experience working with AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have recently been involved with the new Laravel Birmingham meet up and I am scheduled to give
                        talks in
                        the
                        coming months. I want to get involved in the PHP community and in 2015 I kicked this off with
                        LaraconEU.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I participate in various forums and like to follow and keep up to date with the community.
                        Currently I am
                        interested in discussions on software design patterns and testing methodologies.
                    </p>
