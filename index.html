<p>I solve business problems with well designed &amp; tested solid software solutions. I have been working with PHP for over 10 years and take active interest in the latest technologies &amp; best practices in a language which has really started to nicely mature in recent years.</p>

<p>Over the years I have used various frameworks including CodeIgnitor, Fuel, &amp; Kohana 3. I love Composer &amp; Packagist and the structure &amp; ecosystem those bring to PHP application development. When I need more Laravel and Symfony are frameworks I really enjoy to use. Where possible I like to contribute to the open source software I use, including the Laravel core &amp; docs. I have also released Laravel extensions to implement missing functionality for my projects.</p>

<p>Whilst I slightly prefer backend development and have lots of experience in database design and using PHP with MySQL, PostgreSQL, &amp; SQLServer, I also have lots of experience with the front end and I have been experimenting with VueJS recently. Naturally I work with HTML5, CSS3/SASS, lots of jQuery. I love the new frontend build features of Laravel 5 including elixir.</p>

<p>From a devops perspective I have been working with Ubuntu since its inception and daily I work with build processes supporting apps and have experience working with AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean etc.</p>

<p>I have recently been involved with the new Laravel Birmingham meet up and I am scheduled to give talks in the coming months. I want to get involved in the PHP community and in 2015 I kicked this off with LaraconEU.</p>

<p>I participate in various forums and like to follow and keep up to date with the community. Currently I am interested in discussions on software design patterns and testing methodologies.</p>
